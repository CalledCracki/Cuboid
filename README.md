# Cuboid

Cuboid was the first game I programmed in Unity and for which I also invested a lot of time and work.
It was primarily to get to know Unity better as a game engine and to learn the basics of C#.

TO-DO List:

- [x] Publish the first cuboid release
- [ ] Add screenshots to the ReadMe.md
- [ ] Create a proper ReadMe.md file
